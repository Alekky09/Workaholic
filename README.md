This is a final project for CS50x course.

It is a web application for processing my work order excel files and manipulating/organizing them. I made this cause I needed a way to sort all these in an easy way, and see/update their completion status.
It's easily expandable, can be used for other excel worksheets.

I've implemented a number of packages, namely Flask-Login, Flask-Bootstrap, Flask-WTF, WTForms for markup forms and such. SQLAlchemy is used for a heroku-hosted database. Also xlrd package is used for handling excel data.
